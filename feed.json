Since then I have switched to C#, but the concerns have remained mostly unchanged.</p>\n<p>The solution Brian Will suggests on the video is a combination of procedural and functional programming.</p>\n<p>From where I'm standing his solution seems ideal to many of my problems. Separation of data from logic clicks hard with me and I absolutely love certain concepts in functional programming (such a purity of functions) while I would not necessarily want to program fully functionally or abandon the notion of classes and objects altogether.</p>\n<p>If you are interested in functional programming in C# in particular I recommend Enrico Buonanno's book \"<strong>Functional Programming in C#</strong>\", which I own both as a paperback edition and as a digital book.</p>\n<p>However functional programming doesn't come without it's set of problems (to which I won't go in a depth here) and the combination of procedural and functional Brian Will suggest in the video below is a perfect match in my opinion.</p>\n<figure class=\"post__video\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" width=\"560\" height=\"314\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/QM1iUe6IofM\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" data-mce-fragment=\"1\"></iframe></figure>\n<p>My study notes on the video start here:</p>\n<p><strong>Problems with OOP:</strong><br><br><strong>NOT the problem:</strong><br>- Classes<br>- Performance<br>- Abstraction<br>- Aesthetics<br><br><strong>Code Aesthetics DO matter:</strong><br>- Elegance<br>- Simplicity<br>- Flexibility<br>- Readability<br>- Maintenance<br>- Structure<br><br><strong>Competing paradigms:</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Procedural and imperative (the default)</strong><br>- Procedural: \"No explicit association with data types and functions and behaviors.\"<br>- Imperative: \"Mutate state whenever you feel like it. No special handling for shared state. Cope with the problems as they arise.\"<br><br><strong>Procedural and functional (minimize state)</strong><br>- Get rid of state as much as possible.<br>- All or most of the functions should be pure, they should not deal with state.<br><br><strong>Object oriented and imperative (segregate state)</strong><br>- Segregate state. Divide and conquer the problem. Separate everything into objects.<br>- Segregation is a viable strategy up to a point of complexity.<br><br><strong>Claims:</strong><br>- Procedural code is better (even when not functional)<br>- Inheritance is irrelevant.<br>- Polymorphism is not exclusively OOP.<br>- Encapsulation does not work at fine-grained levels of code. This is the biggest problem with OOP.<br>- Fractioning code artificially to follow OOP rules leads to unnecessary complexity which is hard to follow.<br><br><strong>What is an object?</strong><br><br>An object is a bundle of encapsulated state. We don't interact with the state of that object directly. All interactions with that state from the outside world come in through from messages. The object has a defined set of messages called it's interface. We have private information hidden behind the public interface. When an object receives a message it may in turn send messages to other object. We may conceive of an object-oriented program being as a graph of object all communicating with each other by sending messages.<br><br>For object A to send a message to object B, A must hold a private reference to B.<br>Messages may indirectly read and modify state.<br>The moment objects are shared encapsulation flies out of the window.<br><br><strong>Solution, procedural programming:</strong><br><br>- Prefer <strong>functions</strong> over methods. Write <strong>methods</strong> only when the exclusive association with the data type is not in doubt, e.g. ADT's (abstract data types like queues, lists, etc.)<br><br>- When in doubt -&gt; parameterize. Do not encapsulate the state of the program at fine-grained level. However, shared state is a problem. It cannot be fully solved without pure functional programming. This means that rather then passing data through global variables you should instead make that data explicit parameter of the function so it has to be explicitly passed in. Any time you get the temptation to pass in data through a global because it's convenient you should seriously reconsider.<br><br>- When you DO end up with globals - Bundle the globals into structs/records/classes, ie. bundle them logically into data types. Even if this effectively means you have a data type with one instance in your whole program this little trick can often make your code seem just a little bit more organized. In a sense you are just using data types in this way to create tiny little sub namespaces. But if you do a good job logically grouping your globals this way as a side benefit this supports parameterization - you can more conveniently pass this global state to functions.<br><br>- Favor pure functions. If you see an opportunity to make a function pure it's a good policy to take that opportunity. Pure functions are easier to understand and to make correct. This is easier when efficiency is not a priority.<br><br>- You should try to encapsulate (loosely) at the level of namespaces/packages/modules. Think of each package as having it's own private state and public interface.<br><br>- Don't be afraid of long functions! Most programs have key sections. The problem of extracting everything into separate functions breaks up the natural sequence of code and is spread out of order throughout the code base. Prefer commenting each section of the function when needed over extracting the sections. Keep in mind general code readability for long functions:  Prefer extracting to nested functions. Don't stray from left margin too far or for too long. Watch out for too much complexity and split up and extract to other functions as needed. Constrain scope of local variables. When in doubt enclose variables into curly braces to limit their scope - even better, enclose them into their own anonymous functions.</p>\n<p>Good luck!</p>",

After thinking about it for a while I realized that when you look at radians in a certain way, there's an emerging pattern which makes radians intuitive, fun, and easy.</p>\n<p>You know how we're taught about radians that:</p>\n<pre>2π radians = 360°<br>π radians = 180°</pre>\n<p>And so on. And you can do your degree conversions like so:</p>\n<pre> π radians<br>-----------  = 1°<br>    180</pre>\n<p>And it's all right and well, but... radians can sometimes be kind of hard to keep in your head when you do more complex conversions.</p>\n<p>And if you're like me, it's easy to lose track of what you're doing and what the numbers actually represent. You end up going back and forth and becoming confused.</p>\n<p>Don't worry. There's an easier way to visualize radian conversions.</p>\n<p>Take a look at this:</p>\n<pre>2 / 1 * π radians = 360°<br>2 / 2 * π radians = 180°<br>2 / 3 * π radians = 120°<br>2 / 4 * π radians = 90°<br>2 / 5 * π radians = 72°<br>...</pre>\n<p>When we always divide two by parts-of-a-circle we get a really nice uniform and intuitive progression of numbers.</p>\n<p>2 / 1 is of course equal to 2, so that would be the 2π radians, giving us 360°.</p>\n<p>2/2 is of course equal to 1, ie. 180°.</p>\n<p>The only reason I even put them there is to make the whole thing uniform and easy to visualize.</p>\n<p>Notice how the divisor starts from 1 and goes to 2, 3, 4, 5 ... and so on. You can think of the divisor as \"parts of the circle\". Two times π is a full circle, 360°. When your dividend is always two, like in the above example, the divisor then always directly represent into how many parts the circle has been divided into.</p>\n<pre>1 = full circle, 360°.<br>2 = divided into two parts, 180°.<br>3 = divided into three parts, 120°.<br>4 = divided into four parts, 90°.<br>...</pre>\n<figure class=\"post__image\"><img loading=\"lazy\"  src=\"https://Pilvinen.github.io/media/posts/3/Radians-2.png\" sizes=\"(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 768px\" srcset=\"https://Pilvinen.github.io/media/posts/3/responsive/Radians-2-xs.png 300w ,https://Pilvinen.github.io/media/posts/3/responsive/Radians-2-sm.png 480w ,https://Pilvinen.github.io/media/posts/3/responsive/Radians-2-md.png 768w ,https://Pilvinen.github.io/media/posts/3/responsive/Radians-2-lg.png 1024w ,https://Pilvinen.github.io/media/posts/3/responsive/Radians-2-xl.png 1360w ,https://Pilvinen.github.io/media/posts/3/responsive/Radians-2-2xl.png 1600w\"  alt=\"Radians and other units\" width=\"1920\" height=\"1080\"></figure>\n<p>And so on. So, how many radians are in one degree? Easy. There are 360 degrees in a full rotation, so we just drop in 360:</p>\n<pre>2 / 360 * π radians = 1°</pre>\n<p>Why does it work you ask?</p>\n<p>Since there are <em><strong>two</strong></em> π radians in a full circle, dividing two by how many degrees we want we get a multiplier for the conversion and everything stays nice and uniform.</p>\n<p>In my opinion this approach makes it much easier to visualize radians to degrees conversions than using \"π radians =  180°\" as the starting point.</p>",

            "content_html": "<p>Let's take a look at how binary addition can be done by using bitwise operations. Why would we want to do this? Simply because we  can. And also because it's fun and will help us understand how bitwise operations work and can be used together.</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-cs\">\npublic byte AddBytes(byte a, byte b) {\n    while (b != 0) {\n        var carryBits = (byte) (a &amp; b);\n        a = (byte) (a ^ b);\n        b = (byte) (carryBits &lt;&lt; 1);\n    }\n    return a;\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>Let's take an overview of what just happened.</p>\n<p>Essentially we <strong>add</strong> two bytes together. You get that much from the name of the method.</p>\n<p>The signature of the <strong>AddBytes</strong> method also tells us that it takes in two <strong>bytes</strong>, <strong>a</strong> and <strong>b</strong> as parameters, and returns a <strong>byte</strong> which contains the result of the addition.</p>\n<p>Inside the method we loop until <strong>b</strong> is zero. Inside the while loop we <strong>AND</strong> (<strong>&amp;</strong>), then we <strong>XOR</strong> (<strong>^</strong>), and finally we <strong>left shift</strong> (<strong>&lt;&lt;</strong>) by one.</p>\n<p>And, apparently, as a result we get two binary numbers added together nicely, just like in our everyday base-10, where we could calculate something like <code>2 + 2 = 4</code> </p>\n<p>So why does the above piece of code work and do what it does? Let's break it down and make it simple.</p>\n<p>The first operation inside the while loop is storing temporarily in <strong>carryBits</strong> variable the result of the bitwise <strong>AND</strong> (<strong>&amp;</strong>) operation between a and b, ie:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-cs\">var carryBits = (byte) (a &amp; b);</code></pre>\n<p>There's a little bit of casting going on here through and through because C# doesn't support performing bitwise operations directly on the actual <code>byte</code> type, it converts them for the bitwise operations. You could also perform these operations on the <code>int</code> type, for example, in which case you would have:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-cs\">var carryBits = a &amp; b;</code></pre>\n<p>Don't get distracted by the casting.</p>\n<p>So, we're carrying bits. But what is carrying? Let's take a quick refresher on carrying in math. Carrying is just like in normal everyday addition:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-cs\">\n   122\n+  921\n= 1043</code></pre>\n<p>Where you add the numbers together which are on top of each other and you combine them at the bottom for the final result. You have the ones, you have the tens, you have the hundreds, and you have the thousands. In the same way in binary you have the ones, you have the twos, you have the fours, you have the eights, and so on. It's just base-2 (0, and 1) instead of base-10 (0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9) before the numbers flip over to the next scale.</p>\n<p>In the above example carrying happens when you add the one hundred and nine hundred together, you carry the one to the thousands and in hundreds you then have a zero because <code>100 + 900</code> doesn't leave a remainder in the hundreds. If you had <code>100 + 1100</code> instead you  would add the thousands: <code>0 * 1000 + 1 * 1000 = 1000</code>, and then you would add the hundreds: <code>1 * 100 + 1 * 100 = 200</code>. And finally you would add all the different values together (no more carrying to process) and you'd end up with a total of 1200.</p>\n<p>So carrying happens when you add two numbers together (for example <code>9 + 9</code>) and they don't fit in the scale (in this case the ones) and you have to move, ie. you'd have to carry, the overflow to the tens. You'd end up with 18.</p>\n<p>In binary it works in exactly the same way. When you get overflow from addition you move it up, you carry it over.</p>\n<p>The only differences are that in binary you, usually, go from right to left, and 0 means that the value isn't set, and 1 means the value is set. Therefore:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-cs\">1101</code></pre>\n<p>Simply means, from right to left:t 1 * 1 + 0 * 2 + 1 * 4 + 1 * 8. From right to left -&gt; ones (set), twos (not set), fours (set), eights (set). Giving us the total of 13 in our every day base-10.</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-cs\">\nvar a = (byte) 0b_0101; // (This is a \"binary literal\" in C#)\nvar b = (byte) 0b_0110;\nvar carryBits = (byte) (a &amp; b);</code></pre>\n<p>So, when we do a bitwise AND operation, like <code>0101 &amp; 0110</code>(as shown in the above example) simply imagine in your head that you place the numbers on top of each other like in regular base-10 calculus:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-cs\">\n  0101\n&amp; 0110\n= 0100</code></pre>\n<p>The bitwise AND operation returns 1 only when the two overlapping binary numbers are both 1. For all other binary values it returns 0.</p>\n<p>So why are we doing this and storing the result in <code>carryBits</code>? Because it's exactly the same as when you add <code>100 + 900</code>, you know you need to carry the hundreds into thousands, except now you need to carry the overflowing bits. Now we know that there are overlapping values, and when we add them together we will need to carry this bit position to the next one.</p>\n<p>It should be starting to make sense now. Let's move on.</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-cs\">a = (byte) (a ^ b);</code></pre>\n<p>Here we are storing the result of an <strong>XOR</strong> (<strong>^</strong>) operation between a and b in the <strong>a</strong>. We are basically <em>simulating addition</em> with XOR.</p>\n<p>What XOR does is:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-cs\">\n  0101\n^ 0110\n= 0011</code></pre>\n<p> It returns 1 only when the two bits that are being compared are different from each other.</p>\n<p>We have already safely stored the overflowing bits in the temporary <code>carryBits</code>and now we have copied the rest of the bits which are <em>not</em> overflowing (no need to carry anything) to <strong>a</strong>.</p>\n<p>We can now perform the final bitwise operation which is the <strong>left bitshift</strong>. What left bitshift does is that it simply moves all the bits left by whatever number you want to move them. For example:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-cs\">\n  var a = (byte) 0b_0001; // a is 0001\n  a = a &lt;&lt; 1;             // a is 0010\n  a = a &lt;&lt; 1;             // a is 0100\n  a = a &lt;&lt; 1;             // a is 1000\n  a = a &lt;&lt; 1;             // a is 0000</code></pre>\n<p>In the final left bitshift operation we lose our data. By default we get behavior which simply drops overflowing bits - you lose them, they are gone.</p>\n<p>And if you move it by two:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-cs\">\nvar a = (byte) 0b_0001; // a is 0001\na = a &lt;&lt; 2;             // a is 0100</code></pre>\n<p> The bits are simply shifted left by two positions.</p>\n<p>By now you might be starting to realize \"Wait... but what if I have an overflow, carry bit, at position like:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-cs\">1000</code></pre>\n<p>Where there is nowhere to go?\" </p>\n<p>That's right. In that kind of situations you would get an incorrect answer from bitwise binary addition. For simplicity's sake this article doesn't show you how to handle situations like that where you actually run out of space from your value type. It can be handled, but the code gets much more complex and is therefore not a very good place to show the basic principles of binary bitwise addition and is therefore out of the scope of this article.</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-cs\">\nb = (byte) (carryBits &lt;&lt; 1);</code></pre>\n<p>Now that you understand what a left bitshift does, it's not hard to see what's going on here. We're simply <em>moving the carry bits</em>, the overflowing bits, one step further in the scale of numbers. One becomes two, two becomes four, and so on.</p>\n<p>We assign the result into <strong>b</strong>, all the numbers in b just moved one step left. The while loop is now ready for another round until there are no more <code>1</code> bits left in <strong>b</strong>.</p>\n<p>When b is zero we're ready to exit the while-loop and return <strong>a</strong> where we have shifted, combined, and shuffled all of our bits iteration by iteration. We're moving and fitting everything together in a nice and orderly line of bits.</p>\n<p>Logic! There's nothing better.</p>\n<p>If you don't understand binary addition straight away by simply reading this article, don't fret. There's hope for you yet. It's like driving a bicycle. You don't learn how to drive by simply reading a manual. Once you understand the basic principles of binary bitwise operations you have to play with them, and experiment with them.</p>\n<p>That's how you learn.</p>",

But in case you're like me, and you sometimes have difficulties understanding things until you've studied them thoroughly, I will walk you through the gist of it.</p>\n<p>In the example above we have a multi-dimensional <code>3 x 4</code> array. 3 rows (0-2) and 4 columns (0-3) and, and we want to find the index for <code>1,2</code>in other words, we want the index for <strong>row position 1</strong>, <strong>column position 2</strong>, and we want to find that index position in our <em>one dimensional flat array</em> which is essentially emulating a multi-dimensional 3 x 4 array.</p>\n<p>We take the <strong>width</strong> of our <strong>rows</strong>, ie. their actual size (<strong>4</strong> columns wide) and we <strong>multiply</strong> it with the <em>index</em> of the <strong>row</strong> that we want to access (<strong>1</strong>). In other words <code>rowWidth * row</code> ie. <code>4 * 1</code> in our example. This gives us the combined length of all the <em>previous</em> rows of data (because the index starts from 0, we essentially always skip the current one), ie. <strong>row 0</strong> is the previous row in this case. <code>4 * 1 = 4</code>We have 4 entries in all the previous rows.</p>\n<p>Next we want to add our index location on the <strong>column</strong> to this number. This gives us the final index value. In our example our location on the column is 2, therefore we add <code>4 + 2 = 6</code>, giving us the final index of <strong>6</strong>.</p>\n<p>The explanation is probably harder to follow than the code and picture, but there you have it.</p>",
