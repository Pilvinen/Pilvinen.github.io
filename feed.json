They are fast. They are simple to access and iterate through. They can easily be assigned to contiguous memory blocks.</p>\n<p>The above picture shows how indexing works when we turn our multi-dimensional array into a flat array.</p>\n<p>We take the width of our rows and multiply it with the row we want to access. So if we're on row 1 we would want to multiply <code>1 * rowWidth</code>. This gives us the length of the previous rows of data, the rows we've already passed by, ie. row 0 in this case which has 4 entries, ie. <code>1 * 4 = 4</code>.</p>\n<p>Next we want to add our location on the column with the entries we've already passed. This gives us the final index. Our location on the column is 2 in the above example, therefore we add <code>4 + 2 = 6</code>, giving us the final index of 6.</p>",
